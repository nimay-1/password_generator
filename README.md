# Password Generator (v1)

This is my first Python project! The script generates a random password based on user-defined preferences. It allows users to specify the desired password length and choose whether to include letters, digits, and/or symbols. The program ensures that at least one character type is selected before generating a secure password.

## Features
- Specify the length of the password.
- Choose to include letters, digits, and/or symbols.
- Randomly generates a secure password based on user preferences.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git
    cd password-generator
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to:
    - Enter the desired password length.
    - Choose whether to include letters, digits, and/or symbols.

4. The script will then generate and display a random password based on your choices.
